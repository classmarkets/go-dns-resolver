	// duration between sending the DNS query to the server and receiving the
	// response. This duration includes encoding the request packet(s) and
	// parsing the response packet(s). It does not include the time spent on
	// any other recursive queries, such as NS lookups.

	// RTT is set even in case of network errors (but then excludes parsing the
	// response, obviously).
